# Emscripten Web Build

This folder builds the exported LVGL Editor project as `index.html` using the
same generated UI library used by the desktop simulator.

## Prerequisites

Install and activate Emscripten before configuring this target. The official
recommended path is `emsdk`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
cd emsdk
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest
source ./emsdk_env.sh
```

After activation, these commands should be available in the same terminal:

```bash
emcc --version
emcmake --version
emmake --version
```

If you open a new terminal or restart the editor, activate the environment
again:

```bash
source /path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
```

This project also needs CMake, Python 3 and a native C compiler. On macOS,
install the Xcode Command Line Tools if `cc` or `git` is missing.

## Build

From the project root, configure and build with the Emscripten wrappers:

```bash
emcmake cmake -S web-editor -B build-web -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
emmake cmake --build build-web -j
```

Or use the convenience wrapper:

```bash
scripts/web_editor.sh --serve
```

The output is written to:

- `build-web/bin/index.html` - small, editable HTML shell
- `build-web/bin/index.js` - Emscripten runtime with the WebAssembly payload
  embedded via `-sSINGLE_FILE=1`

There is no required separate `.wasm` fetch.

To build one self-contained HTML file instead, enable `WEB_SINGLE_HTML`:

```bash
emcmake cmake -S web-editor -B build-web-single \
  -DUI_DIR=/path/to/exported/ui \
  -DWEB_SINGLE_HTML=ON
emmake cmake --build build-web-single -j --target index
```

or:

```bash
scripts/web_editor.sh --single-html
```

In the default mode, `-sSINGLE_FILE=1` embeds the WebAssembly payload into
`index.js`, but the preview still has separate `index.html` and `index.js`
files. With `WEB_SINGLE_HTML=ON`, Emscripten injects the runtime into
`index.html`, and the preview output is just `index.html`.

## Run

Serve the output over HTTP:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 -d build-web/bin
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

The first display size in `project.xml` is used by default. Override it with
query parameters when testing another target:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/?w=240&h=280
```

## Assets

The web build defaults to a plain LVGL canvas without an overlay. To opt in to
the optional hardware frame, clickable button hit regions and on-screen key
overlay, configure with:

```bash
emcmake cmake -S web-editor -B build-web \
  -DWEB_ENABLE_KEY_OVERLAY=ON
```

When enabled, `web-editor/assets` is copied next to the generated `index.html`
and `index.js`.

The assets are:

- `assets/key_overlay.json` - frame image path, display offset, button positions,
  labels and keyboard mappings.
- `assets/hardware_frame.png` - the hardware image referenced by the
  JSON.

When the overlay is enabled, CMake embeds `key_overlay.json` into `index.html`
as a fallback and also copies the assets next to the generated web files. At
runtime, `index.html` fetches `key_overlay.json` from beside itself and uses
that JSON to:

- place the LVGL canvas inside the frame via `hardwareFrame.ui.x/y`;
- load the frame image from `hardwareFrame.image` and use the loaded image's
  natural dimensions as the frame size;
- create invisible clickable hardware button regions from each button's
  `x/y/width/height` and optional `radius`;
- create the floating key overlay from `label`, `key`, `columns` and
  `controlsOverlay`.

Because the JSON is fetched at runtime, you can change `key_overlay.json` after
the build and reload the browser to try new button mappings or frame geometry.
The frame PNG can also be replaced after the build as long as the filename still
matches `hardwareFrame.image`, or the JSON is updated to the new filename.
When `WEB_SINGLE_HTML=ON` and `WEB_ENABLE_KEY_OVERLAY=ON`, the embedded
build-time JSON and frame image are used instead, so changes need a rebuild.

Button hit-region rounding is configured in the JSON. Use top-level
`buttonRadius` as the default for all hardware regions, and use `radius` on a
button to override it. Numeric values are treated as pixels; strings are passed
through as CSS, so both `18` and `"50%"` are valid.

Use `maxScale` to cap how far the preview is enlarged. A value of `1` keeps the
UI and frame at native pixel size unless the viewport is smaller, in which case
the whole device shrinks to fit.

The frame is only shown at the native display size from `project.xml`. If you
override the display with `?w=` or `?h=`, the preview shows the bare canvas and
keeps the key overlay available, so the frame cut-out and button coordinates do
not drift out of alignment.

If `key_overlay.json` is missing or contains `{ "enabled": false }`, the web
preview falls back to a plain LVGL canvas centered in the browser. No hardware
frame image is shown, no clickable button regions are created, and no floating
key overlay is displayed. The canvas still uses the display size from
`project.xml`, or the `?w=` / `?h=` query parameters.

To reuse the web editor for another project, either replace the files in
`web-editor/assets` or point CMake at a different assets directory:

```bash
emcmake cmake -S web-editor -B build-web \
  -DUI_DIR=/path/to/exported/ui \
  -DWEB_ASSETS_DIR=/path/to/my-assets
```

Disable the frame and controls by passing a directory without
`key_overlay.json`, or by using a JSON file with:

```json
{ "enabled": false }
```

## Reuse

- `web-editor/CMakeLists.txt` fetches LVGL, generates `lv_conf.h`, and adds the
  selected UI project as `lib-ui`.
- `file_list_gen.cmake` and `user_config.cmake` remain the shared source lists,
  so generated UI files and custom code are automatically reused.
- `web-editor/lv_conf_emscripten.defaults` contains only the LVGL options that
  differ for the browser target.
